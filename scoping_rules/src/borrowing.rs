/*
 Borrowing
 Most of the time, we'd like to access data without taking ownership over it.
 To accomplish this, Rust uses a borrowing mechanism. Instead of passing objects
 by value (T), objects can be passed by reference (&T).

 The compiler statically guarantees (via its borrow checker) that references always
 point to valid objects. That is, while references to an object exist,
 the object cannot be destroyed.

// This function takes ownership of a box and destroys it
// parameter is passed by value.
fn eat_box_i32(boxed_i32: Box<i32>) {
    println!("Destroying box that contains {}", boxed_i32);
}

// This function borrows an i32, parameters passed by reference.
fn borrow_i32(borrowed_i32: &i32) {
    println!("This int is: {}", borrowed_i32);
}

pub fn show_borrowing() {
    let boxed_i32 = Box::new(5_i32); // from the heap (pointer)
    let stacked_i32 = 6_i32; // from the stack

    // Borrow the contents of the box. Ownership is not taken,
    // so the contents can be borrowed again.
    borrow_i32(&boxed_i32);
    borrow_i32(&stacked_i32);

    {
        // Take a reference to the data contained inside the box
        let _ref_to_i32: &i32 = &boxed_i32;

        // TODO: remove this line of code, it will error
        // we cannot move and transfer the ownership of this data
        // because another we are still borrowing it later in the code
        // eat_box_i32(boxed_i32);

        // Attempt to borrow `_ref_to_i32` after inner value is destroyed
        borrow_i32(_ref_to_i32);
        // `_ref_to_i32` goes out of scope and is no longer borrowed.

        // we can successfully move it here
    }

    // `boxed_i32` can now give up ownership to `eat_box` and be destroyed
    eat_box_i32(boxed_i32);
}

// Mutable Reference
// Some situations will arise when we want to borrow a mutable data
// and not transfer its ownership, we just want to update the data
// keep it still in its memory location.
//
// Mutable data can be mutably borrowed using &mut T.
// This is called a mutable reference and gives read/write access to the borrower.
// In contrast, &T borrows the data via an immutable reference, and the borrower
// can read the data but not modify it:

#[allow(dead_code)]
#[derive(Clone, Copy)]

    // `&'static str` is a reference to a string allocated in read only memory
    author: &'static str,
    title: &'static str,

// This function takes a reference to a book
// no ownership is transferred, just borrowing not moving.
// I have a read access.

    println!("I immutably borrowed {} - {} edition", book.title, book.year);

// This function takes a reference to a mutable book and modifies it.
// I have a read and write access to the Book data.

        year: 1979,

    // Borrow a mutable object as mutable
    new_edition(&mut mutable_book);

    // Error! Cannot borrow an immutable object as mutable
    // new_edition(&mut immutabook);
}

// Aliasing
// Data can be immutably borrowed any number of times, but while immutably borrowed,
// the original data can't be mutably borrowed.
// On the other hand, only one mutable borrow is allowed at a time. The original data
// can be borrowed again only after the mutable reference has been used for the last time.
// i.e the use goes out of scope.
